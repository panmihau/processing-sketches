# TriangleCut_clickable

A sketch which creates patterns based on two grids of square tiles. The two grids have identical dimensions, but one of them is shifted by *(+tileSize/2, +tileSize/2)*. The squares have triangle cutouts of variable dimensions.

Left click generates a new pattern with a random tile size. Right click draws a new pattern on top of the existing canvas with the same tile size.

## Sample results
